    <b>Lenovo’s story has always been about shaping computing intelligence to create a better world. With the world’s widest portfolio of technology products, we deliver our vision of Smarter Technology for All through products, solutions, software, and services that individuals, communities, businesses, and entire populations need to fulfill their potential.</b><br><br>
    <p>Today, industries are reshaping and reimaging what they make and how they do it. Virtual healthcare. Remote education. Smarter shopping. Smarter technology must be made for all. As a Fortune Global 500 technology company and one of Fortune Magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies, we think and act globally. Breakthroughs aren’t born in a bubble, and it takes all kinds of people and points of view to make technology smart. We’re proud to leverage the diversity of our more than 63,000 employees to serve customers in 180 markets to redefine and stretch the limits of what technology can do.
<br><br>
We believe we can impact society most when we work together. That’s why we have committed to the GSMA Digital Declaration that identifies shared values across the technology industry for an ethical digital future.</p>

<div class="are1">
    <h2>Our Company
</h2>
    <small>   What makes us capable of leading Intelligent Transformation? Our credentials.</small>
    <div class="co">
        <h3>Full Portfolio</h3>
        <p>We deliver a full portfolio of PCs and tablets, monitors, accessories, smartphones, smart home and smart collaboration solutions, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), commercial Internet of Things (IoT), software, services, and smart infrastructure data center solutions around the world. Since 1995 we have shipped more than half a billion PCs, and we make three devices every second. Our Lenovo Neptune™ water-cooling technology for high performance computing (HPC) environments has made us the #1 provider of systems on the global TOP500 supercomputer list. Lenovo has been included as one of the initial members of the new Hang Seng TECH Index, making us one of the 30 largest qualifying tech companies currently on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.</p></div>
    
    <div class="co">
        <h3>We understand transformation</h3>
        <p>Just as we’ve transformed our business over more than three decades we have helped countless organizations, from healthcare, education, retail, manufacturing, logistics, professional services, and more, re-think the way they use technology to revitalize their business through smarter solutions that leverage hardware, software, and services.</p></div>
    
    <div class="co"><h3>Global scale and manufacturing</h3>
        <p>We serve more than 180 markets, and we own the majority of our facilities, giving us unrivaled scale, efficiency, and control of our supply chain. Our global manufacturing allows tailored offerings to regional markets and includes more than 30 manufacturing facilities, including in-house, joint venture, original design manufacturer, and contract manufacturer sites in Argentina, Brazil, China, Germany, Hungary, India, Japan, Mexico, and USA.</p></div>
    <small>We manufacture the majority of our products in our own facilities—more than most other hardware suppliers. This hybrid model helps us bring new innovations to market efficiently while having greater control over product development and supply chain for advantages in quality, security, and time-to-market. Recently, Gartner ranked us #15 on their list of Top 25 World Class Supply Chains.</small>
    
</div>
<div class="are2">
    <h2>Strategy</h2>
    <small> Lenovo’s ‘3S’ strategy encompasses smart IoT, smart infrastructure, and smart verticals to help us deliver service-led transformation. We solve business challenges by becoming our customer’s trusted source for hardware, software, and services.<br><br>

The services we offer as part of service-led transformation are categorized into three layers:

</small>
    <div class="co1">
        <h3>Attached Services</h3>
        <p>Services sold with the hardware and cover what’s needed to keep the product running across its lifecycle, including post-sale service and support. Some of these Attached Services include Lenovo <b>Premier Support</b> and <b>Premium Care</b>. These services lead to our next level of service-led transformation – Managed Services and DaaS.</p></div>
    
    <div class="co1">
        <h3>Managed Services and Device-as-a-Service (Daas)</h3>
        <p>Managed Services allow customers to outsource the responsibility of managing their IT infrastructure to Lenovo. DaaS makes our hardware, services, and software available via a lease-like model rather than an outright purchase. <b>Lenovo DaaS </b>and <b>Lenovo TruScale</b> are examples of our as-a-service offerings.</p></div>
    
    <div class="co1"><h3>Complex Solutions</h3>
        <p>Complex Solutions incorporate hardware, software, and services as well as Lenovo’s own intellectual property (IP) through ‘Lenovo Smart Solutions’ to provide repeatable solutions to improve customers’ productivity. A complex solution starts with understanding a customer’s business problem and then designing and implementing a solution to address it. These solutions can be through integrating systems or providing a smart solution. We offer Smart Solutions, for example, to help make offices safer and smarter with <b>ThinkIoT Back to Work Solutions</b>.</p></div>
